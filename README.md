Summary
-------

PerseoNXT is a modern, performance-optimized Nuxt3 theme developed by Giovanni Manetti. Designed specifically for WikiHerbalist.com, this theme leverages the latest web technologies to provide a superior encyclopedia experience. Unlike traditional WordPress themes, PerseoNXT is built with Vue.js and utilizes Nuxt3's static generation capabilities, ensuring fast load times and efficient content delivery.
